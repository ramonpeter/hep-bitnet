# Experiments

We perform differentexperiments:

1. **2_moons**: A toy generative application of Normalizing Flows in a notebook based on the 2 Moons dataset.
2. **MNIST**: A toy classification application in a notebook based on the MNIST dataset.
3. **CaloINN**: A physics application based on [arXiv:2312.09290](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09290) and taken from [CaloINN git](https://github.com/heidelberg-hepml/CaloINN)
4. **SMEFTNet**: A physics application based on [arXiv:2401.10323](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10323) and taken from [SMEFTNet git](https://github.com/HephyAnalysisSW/SMEFTNet/tree/master/)


Our initial idea was :
1. **Regression:** MadMiner GNN..
2. **Classification:** JetNet..
3. **Generation:** CaloINN taken from [arXiv:2312.09290](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09290) ..

More details are given in each sub-folder.
