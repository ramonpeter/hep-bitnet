# Experiments

We perform different experiments:

1. **PDAT**: A classification network to perform quak-gluon discrimination which is based on [arXiv:2307.04723](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04723)
2. **SMEFTNet**: A regression network to infer SMEFT parameters based on [arXiv:2401.10323](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10323) and taken from [SMEFTNet](https://github.com/HephyAnalysisSW/SMEFTNet/tree/master/)
3. Detector Simulation:
    - **CaloINN**: Normalizing flow based calorimeter simulation as proposed in [arXiv:2312.09290](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09290) adapted from [[code]](https://github.com/heidelberg-hepml/CaloINN)
    - **CaloDREAM**: Flow-matching and transformer based calorimeter simulation as proposed in [arXiv:2405.09629](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09629) adapted from [[code]](https://github.com/heidelberg-hepml/calo_dreamer)

More details are given in each sub-folder.
